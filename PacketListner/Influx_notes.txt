# Database design
    With influx 1.8 do not use same measurement name across retention policies
    Some commands do not allow specifying RP
        eg. delete from m30.temp where "yr_mo" = ''
            result: ERR: error parsing query: retention policy not supported at line 1, char 1
    group by only works with time and tags; field must be a tag if you want to use group by in queries
    Show field name and type by measurement
    show field keys & show tag keys  only works on default retention policy 
        work around copy rp.measurement to default rp then show field keys
        > select * into s5.m30_temp from m30.temp
        > show field keys

# Command Line Interface CLI
    precision rfc3339  # will cause time to be returned in readable format

# Query tricks and tequnics
    Query output doesn't include tags unless it is an into query or a continuous query
    to get tags use group by * or "tag name"


try double quotes in: drop measurement "m30"."battery"  Works
query: select * from m30.battery WHERE time > now() - 60s
> select * FROM s30.battery WHERE time > now() - 1h
$ sudo systemctl start PacketListner
sudo systemctl status PacketListner

delete does not support specifying retention policy

Preserve tags when copying measures, always group by *:
select * into s5.s5_inverter from d1.ts5_inverter group by *
